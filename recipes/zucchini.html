            <h3>Ingredients:</h3>

            <ul>
                <li>1 ½ pounds zucchini</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon salt</li> 
                <li>2 teaspoons sugar</li>
                <li>¼ teaspoon Sichuan peppercorn powder</li>
                <li>1½ teaspoons sesame oil</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon light soy sauce</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon rice vinegar</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon minced garlic</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon chili oil</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons toasted sesame seeds</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Steps:</h3>
            <p><strong>1.</strong> Wash the zucchini and pat dry with a clean towel. Trim off the ends, and cut each zucchini in half lengthwise. <br>Scoop out any large seeds from the middle. Then use a julienne peeler, spiralizer, or just a knife to cut the zucchini into long thin strands or julienne it.</p>
            <p><strong>2.</strong> In a bowl, sprinkle the salt over the zucchini, and toss it well. Let it stand for 20 minutes on the counter.</p>
            <p><strong>3.</strong> Make the dressing by combining the sugar, Sichuan peppercorn powder, sesame oil, light soy sauce, lemon juice and rice vinegar. Stir until the sugar is completely dissolved.</p>
            <p><strong>4.</strong> After 20 minutes, discard the liquid at the bottom of the bowl of zucchini, and gently squeeze out some of the liquid from the zucchini.</p>
            <p><strong>5.</strong> Right before serving, mix the zucchini with the prepared dressing, garlic and chili oil if using. Garnish with sesame seeds, and serve immediately.</p>
