        <h1>Smashed cucumber salad</h1>

        <p>This Smashed Asian cucumber salad recipe is one of our most popular recipes for a reason! It’s light, refreshing and easy to make in just 10 minutes. 
            <br>It’s also packed with flavor from a zingy dressing, garlic, and cilantro.</p>

            <h3>Ingredients:</h3>

            <ul>
                <li>1-1.5 pounds seedless cucumbers</li>
                <li>teaspoon salt</li> 
                <li>2 1/2 teaspoons sugar</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons sesame oil</li>
                <li>3 teaspoons light soy sauce</li>
                <li>1 1/2 tablespoons rice vinegar</li>
                <li>2-4 cloves garlic (finely chopped)</li>
                <li>1-2 teaspoons chili oil (optional)</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons toasted sesame seeds</li>
                <li>1/4 cup chopped cilantro</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Steps:</h3>
            <p><strong>1.</strong> Wash the cucumbers and pat them dry with a clean towel. <br>Make the salad dressing by combining the salt, sugar, sesame oil, light soy sauce, and rice vinegar. <br>Stir until the sugar and salt are completely dissolved. Set aside.</p>
            <p><strong>2.</strong> On a cutting board, lay a large knife flat against the cucumber, and smash it lightly with your other hand. <br>The cucumber should crack open and smash into four sections. Repeat along its full length. <br>Once the whole cucumber is completely open (usually into 4 long sectional pieces), cut it at a 45-degree angle into bite-sized pieces.</p>
            <p><strong>3.</strong> In a large bowl, mix the cut cucumber with the prepared dressing, garlic and chili oil. <br>Toss it well. Serve, garnished with sesame seeds and cilantro. (Note: if you prefer to omit the chili oil, heat up a tablespoon of oil in a pan and drizzle it over the cucumber. <br>Seems weird, but in Chinese cooking, uncooked vs. cooked oil have different flavors and are treated as such!)</p>
